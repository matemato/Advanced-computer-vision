#   1. Take derivative of the following function:
#     f(x) = (x + x^3)^4 - x

#   SOLUTION: f(x)' = 4(x + x^3)^3 * (1 + 3x^2) - 1

#   2. Linearize the following function at x0: f(x) = x + 2x^2
#
#   Write the equation of a line tangent at 𝑥0 = 3:

#   a) First derive the form: 𝑓(𝑥0 + 𝛿) =?
#   b) Then write the linear approximation of 𝑓(𝑥) at 𝑥0, i.e., 𝑓(𝑥) |𝑥0 ≈?

#   SOLUTION:
#       a) f(𝑥0 + 𝛿) = f(𝑥0) + df
